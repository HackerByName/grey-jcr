			p Welcome to the welfare section of the JCR website! Hopefully this website will be a good resource for you, but it is no substitute for having a chat with somebody. We're always around to talk - feel free to get in touch. You can visit us in the welfare room, call us on 07729409817 or use our anonymous online support system.

				h3(class="ui header") How does College Welfare Work?
				p University can be a very exciting time, but it also can be really daunting and unnerving. Though people might be very happy most of the time, there are sometimes those who are not. That's where the college welfare team come in. We provide a confidential, listening, support and signposting service to allow you to come and talk to another student. You can talk to the welfare team about literally anything even if you just fancy a chat. We also have loads of information leaflets and we can point you in the right direction if you need contact details for hospitals, clinics or professional advice. The team also organise and run campaign weeks in college from SHAG (Sexual Health and Guidance) week to Mental Health Awareness Week. The aim of these is to promote awareness and provide members of college with useful information.

				h3(class="ui header") How do you find us?
				p We run welfare hours 3 times a week, in the evening/afternoon, during which anyone can drop in to talk to the team member on duty about anything, in confidence. Welfare hours are held in the Welfare Room which is located on the bottom floor of Hollingside, opposite the laundry room. You can find out which member of the team is running the drop-ins by looking at the rota which is emailed out to college. They are held on Tuesday and Thursday 6.30-8.30pm and Saturday 2-4pm. Alternatively you can contact us on the welfare phone (07729409817).
				p You can also use the anonymous online support system to send an anonymous message to the Male and Female Welfare Officers from whom you should receive a reply from within 24 hours. Click <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/grey.welfare">here</a> to access this service.
				p So make sure you all look out for the welfare team we are here to support you any time you need it, to make sure everyone enjoys their university experience as much as they can.
				h4(class="ui header") Pregnancy Testing
				p Free pregnancy tests can be taken from the welfare room at any time during drop in. The test is very simple and only takes a few minutes. Please contact a member of the welfare team if you would like a test out of drop in hours or would like them to help you.
				h4(class="ui header") Chlamydia Testing
				p In the same way we offer free chlamydia tests - these can be done in your own time and dropped down to the Durham SU. Results come back quite quickly. We have an awareness week when we encourage people to get the test done, but you can get one at any time from the welfare room.
				h4(class="ui header") Condoms
				p Condoms can be bought from the condom machines around college, 3 for a pound. These machines can be found in the laundry room on the bottom floor of Hollingside, just opposite the welfare room, in the laundry room in Oswald East and in the laundry room in Elvet. Alternatively, you can buy condoms, including latex free condoms, 5 for a pound, from the welfare room during drop ins.

				h3(class="ui header") Getting involved in Welfare
				p Would you like to get involved in welfare? Whilst at Durham, there are several opportunities to get involved in welfare: be at Grey, through Nightline or Durham SU.
				h4(class="ui header") College Welfare team
				p The new Welfare team will be picked during the second term of the year. The Male and Female Welfare Officers will also be elected during Epiphany term and anyone who would like to run for the roles can stand for either Male or Female Welfare Officer.
				p If you would like to apply to be on the Welfare team or run for the role as a Welfare Officer â€“ feel free to get in touch with the current team to answer any question you might have.
				h4(class="ui header") Nightline
				p Nightline is a listening service run by students for students and is open every night of term between 9pm and 7am.  They are there to listen to you about anything on your mind such as friends, relationships, stress, late night thoughts, and more.
				p Nightline is based on 5 principles: confidentiality, anonymity, non-advisory, non-judgmental, and non-aligned. So, you can be ensured that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.
				p You can contact them by calling their number which is found on DUO and the back of your campus card or online via their instant messaging system which can be found on their website: <a href="https://durhamnightline.com/">durhamnightline.com</a>

They are also Ex-Offico members of all the committees in the College and the JCR and sit on them when required.
